Practicing

Hi!

I´m just practicing writing with my own code a landing page from one of the Adobe tutorials.
They created this page for a Dreamweaver/CSS tutorial.

At the same time, I just signed in into GitHub so I´m learning how to use it properly.

The original page from Adobe is named Original-design.png and my html file is named prueba adobe.html
